# REPORT of the developing process

First of all, i try to use the less amount of libraris i could. Also didnt use Hooks just to show i can deal with legacy apps with classes and functions of the life cicle like componentDidMount, etc...

    - The most challenging thing about it, was the poor information about the functionalities, so i had to look closely and carefully to the mockup to find out the functionalities spected from the app.

    - Also, was a little tricky for me to thinck in how many ways the info from the db could come. So i made an array with objects.

    - The differents way to show the dates took me a little bit long to treat, cuz i was trying not to use a library.

    - The most difficult part of it, was me, saying to my self 'this could took half of the time with Hooks'.

    -I hope you like my job.
