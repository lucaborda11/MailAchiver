# IMPROVMENTS for MailArchiver

    - More filter and options for the user to find what he's/she's looking for.
    - I would add more options for the user to open the emails. Like Ctr+Click to open it in a new Window & Shift+Click to open it in a new tab. So the user can keep serching while the things he/she found still opened.


Those are the things I can think of with the information provided. To think of new tools and options, I would need a more detailed survey.
